# Hey, I’m Aben 👋

I’m a student developer with a strong interest in backend systems, logic-driven programming, and real-world workflow simulation.  
I enjoy building projects that focus on clean architecture, modular design, and maintainable code, primarily using Python.

While my background includes backend-oriented programming projects, my current academic focus is Aerospace Engineering. As a result, I am expanding my skill set by applying Python beyond core computer science concepts particularly toward data analytics and computational problem-solving to support engineering analysis and learning.
